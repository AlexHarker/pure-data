#### [using slop~ in a compander-limiter](#topics-slop-compander-limiter)

A subpatch of the [slop~ help file](file:../5.reference/slop~-help.pd) gives an
example that uses slop~ to make a compander-limiter.  (The link will only work
if you are reading this document as a local file on your machine and if your
browser is set up to open .pd files using Pd.  Alternatively you can create a
slop~ object in a patch and get help for it).  Here is
[additional documentation for the slop~ object itself](slop-tilde.htm).

(TBW... just testing the directory layout and links for now.)
