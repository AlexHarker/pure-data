#X text 32 69 This is an attempt at making a version of snapshot~ that
trades off delay for time jitter control. The behaviour is the same
as snapshot~ (it takes a bang and converts a signal to a float. The
idea is that you can convert from an audio signal and get a specific
value within an audio block depending on the exact time it receives
a bang. Unfortunately it isn't fully correct and will be replaced by
a more correct one in the future. Since this change will probably be
incompatible with this object \, it is probably best to avoid using
it until it is working correctly., f 73;
