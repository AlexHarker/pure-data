#X text 39 114 The block~ and switch~ objects set the block size \,
overlap \, and up/down-sampling ratio for the window. (The overlap
and resampling ratio are relative to the super-patch.), f 62;
#X text 39 292 You may have at most one block~/switch~ object in any
window., f 62;
#X text 39 242 A switch~ with no arguments does not reblock audio computation
-- in other words \, block size and sample rate are as in the parent
patch., f 62;
#X text 45 631 see also:;
#X obj 122 671 fft~;
#X text 39 164 Switch~ \, in addition \, allows you to switch DSP on
and off for the window. All subwindows are also switched. (If a subwindow
of a switched window is also switched \, both switches must be on for
the subwindow's audio DSP to run. Pd's global DSP must also be on.)
, f 62;
#X text 39 315 Pd's default block size is 64 samples. The inlet~ and
outlet~ objects reblock signals to adjust for differences between parent
and subpatch \, but only power-of-two adjustments are possible. So
for "normal" audio computations \, all blocks should also be power-of-two
in size. HOWEVER \, if you have no inlet~ or outlet~ you may specify
any other block size. This is intended for later use in video processing.
, f 62;
#X text 39 421 Switch~ takes a "bang" message that causes one block
of DSP to be computed. This might be useful for pre-computing waveforms
or window functions \, or also for video processing., f 62;

#X text 32 61 Dac~ and adc~ don't work correctly if reblocked \, nor
if a parent window is reblocked \, even if the window containing the
dac~ or adc~ is reblocked back to the default block size and sample
rate.;
#X text 33 209 Patches using send~/receive~ or throw~/catch~ to intercommunicate
must have the same blocking -- and if their parents are blocked bigger
than they are \, there might be weirdness.;
#X text 31 128 If using send~ or delwrite~ from a switched-off patch
\, the output of corresponding receive~ and delread~ objects in other
\, running patches will cycle old input (and sound like garbage). Throw~
may be switched with impunity \, but not catch~.;
