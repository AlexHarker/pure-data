from a corresponding delwrite~ object. The delay in milliseconds of
the tap is specified by the incoming signal., f 60;

#X text 48 141 The delay time is always at least one sample and at
most the length of the delay line (specified by a corresponding delwrite~).
In addition \, in case the delwrite~ runs later in the DSP loop than
the delread4~ \, the delay is constrained below by one vector length
(64 samples.) An example showing how to control this to obtain very
short delays is included in doc/3.audio.examples/G05.execution.order.pd
